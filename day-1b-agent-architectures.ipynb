Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

What if there was a way to empower your development process with a team of intelligent, specialized \"assistants\" working collaboratively? Enter Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a revolutionary approach that's transforming how software is built.\n\nAt its core, a MAS involves multiple autonomous software entities, or \"agents,\" each with specific goals and capabilities. These agents don't just work in isolation; they communicate, coordinate, and collaborate to achieve a shared objective. Think of it like a highly efficient human development team, but powered by software.\n\nHow does this supercharge your workflow? MAS can expertly decompose large tasks, allowing specialized agents to work in parallel. Imagine agents dedicated to automated code generation, refactoring, and even intelligent testing that tirelessly explores scenarios and pinpoints bugs. This frees you from the repetitive and allows you to focus on the creative, architectural aspects of development.\n\nThe benefits extend further. MAS can enhance system resilience, enabling self-healing and adaptation to changing requirements. Agents can learn from each other, fostering continuous improvement within your codebase. Ultimately, by automating the mundane, MAS unlocks your potential for greater creativity and innovation.\n\nWhile the concept might seem advanced, exploring MAS is an investment in the future. Grasping key concepts like communication protocols and coordination mechanisms, and experimenting with frameworks like JADE or AgentPy, can set you on the path to more efficient and intelligent development. The era of the solitary coder is evolving; it's time to harness the collective power of intelligent agents.\nEditorAgent > ## Beyond Solo Code: Unleash the Power of Multi-Agent Systems in Your Development Workflow\n\nAre you drowning in a sea of tasks, grappling with complex problems alone, or finding it challenging to maintain a clean and efficient codebase? Imagine empowering your development process with a team of intelligent, specialized \"assistants\" working collaboratively. This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a revolutionary approach poised to transform software development.\n\n### What Exactly Are Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)?\n\nAt its heart, a MAS comprises multiple autonomous software entities, or \"agents.\" Each agent possesses specific goals, unique capabilities, and the ability to perceive its environment and act upon it. Crucially, these agents don't operate in isolation. Instead, they engage in communication, coordination, and collaboration to achieve a common objective. Think of it as an exceptionally efficient human development team, but powered entirely by software.\n\nWhile the concept might sound futuristic, examples of MAS are already present in various domains:\n\n*   **Intelligent Traffic Management:** Agents control traffic signals, optimize flow, and react to real-time conditions.\n*   **Supply Chain Optimization:** Agents manage inventory, predict demand, and coordinate logistics across different entities.\n*   **Sophisticated Game AI:** Agents exhibit complex behaviors, adapt to player strategies, and create dynamic game environments.\n\n### Supercharging Your Development Process with MAS\n\nThe integration of MAS into your development workflow promises significant advantages:\n\n*   **Task Decomposition and Parallelization:** MAS excels at breaking down large, intricate development tasks into smaller, manageable units. Specialized agents can then tackle these units simultaneously, dramatically accelerating development cycles.\n*   **Automated Code Generation and Refactoring:** Picture agents dedicated to generating boilerplate code, identifying and rectifying bugs, or even suggesting performance enhancements. This automation liberates developers from mundane, repetitive tasks, allowing them to concentrate on higher-level creative and architectural endeavors.\n*   **Intelligent Testing and Debugging:** Agents can function as tireless testers, systematically exploring vast scenario landscapes and collaboratively pinpointing the root cause of complex bugs far more efficiently than traditional methods.\n\n### Advanced Benefits for the Modern Developer\n\nThe advantages of MAS extend beyond immediate task completion:\n\n*   **Enhanced System Resilience and Adaptability:** MAS can contribute to self-healing systems. Agents can adapt to evolving requirements or gracefully handle failures in individual components, ensuring continued functionality and robustness.\n*   **Knowledge Sharing and Continuous Learning:** Agents can learn from each other's experiences, share insights, and contribute to a codebase that continuously improves and evolves over time.\n*   **Boosting Creativity and Innovation:** By automating routine and time-consuming processes, MAS frees up valuable developer bandwidth. This allows for a greater focus on innovation, architectural design, and exploring novel solutions to challenging problems.\n\n### Getting Started with MAS: A Gentle Introduction\n\nWhile the concept of MAS might seem advanced, it's an accessible and valuable investment in the future of software development. To begin your journey:\n\n*   **Grasp Key Concepts:** Familiarize yourself with fundamental MAS principles such as communication protocols (how agents interact), coordination mechanisms (how they work together), and agent architectures (their internal design).\n*   **Explore Tools and Frameworks:** Experiment with established MAS frameworks like JADE or AgentPy. You can also explore conceptual implementations using popular programming languages like Python.\n*   **Embrace the Collaborative Future:** The era of the solitary coder is rapidly evolving. By understanding and integrating MAS, you're not just adopting new technology; you're unlocking a more efficient, intelligent, and ultimately, more creative path to building the software of tomorrow.\n\nIt's time to think beyond solo code and harness the collective power of intelligent agents to elevate your development workflow.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"👏 Great job!

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-12T00:02:43.853969Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-12T00:02:43.855072Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-12T00:02:43.860798Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-12T00:02:43.855014Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-12T00:02:43.859505Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

A brief sentence or two about the familiarity and predictability of her coffee routine would make the contrast with the new matcha experience more impactful. For example, \"Her morning coffee was more than just a drink; it was the anchor to her day, a predictable warmth before the world demanded her attention.\"\n\n2.  **Expand on the Sensory Experience of Matcha:** You describe the aroma and taste well, but consider adding more sensory details to draw the reader further in. How does the powder feel as she whisks it? Is there a particular texture to the foam? Does the color itself evoke any feelings or thoughts? For instance, you could add something like, \"As she whisked, the fine emerald dust bloomed into a frothy jade, the whisk leaving swirling patterns that felt almost meditative.\"\n\n3.  **Show, Don't Just Tell, the \"Gentle Energy\":** The phrase \"A wave of gentle energy washed over her, a calm alertness that coffee never provided\" is a good summary, but showing this effect would be more engaging. How does this \"calm alertness\" manifest in her actions or thoughts *after* she drinks it? Does she find herself more focused on a task, or perhaps notice something small she usually overlooks? A brief glimpse of this post-matcha state would solidify the change.\nRefinerAgent > Elara had always been a creature of habit.
