Drug discovery is one of the areas where AI is having a *profound* and rapidly accelerating impact. Here are some of the newest and most significant developments in AI-powered drug discovery:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **Beyond Predicting Properties, Creating New Ones:** While earlier AI focused on predicting the properties of existing molecules, **generative AI models** (like those based on GANs or diffusion models) are now capable of **designing entirely new molecular structures** from scratch. These models can be trained on vast datasets of known drugs and chemical compounds and then tasked with creating molecules that possess specific desired characteristics (e.g., binding affinity to a target, low toxicity, good pharmacokinetic properties).\n*   **De Novo Design Platforms:** Companies are developing sophisticated platforms that use generative AI to explore vast chemical spaces and propose novel drug candidates that human chemists might not have conceived of. This drastically expands the pool of potential drugs.\n\n**2. Advanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Unraveling Complex Biological Pathways:** AI is becoming increasingly adept at analyzing multi-omics data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) to identify novel drug targets implicated in diseases. It can uncover subtle relationships and pathways that are too complex for traditional analysis.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models are being developed to assess whether a newly identified target is \"druggable\" – meaning whether it's feasible to design a molecule that can effectively interact with it.\n\n**3. Enhanced Predictive Modeling for Efficacy and Safety:**\n\n*   **More Accurate In Silico Trials:** AI is moving beyond simple toxicity predictions to create more realistic **\"in silico\" (computer-simulated) trials**. These models can predict how a drug might perform in human trials by considering factors like patient variability, drug metabolism, and potential drug-drug interactions.\n*   **\"Digital Twins\" for Drug Testing:** The concept of creating \"digital twins\" of patients or even organs is gaining traction. These AI-powered simulations could allow for personalized drug testing without needing to administer the drug to a real person initially.\n\n**4.

This is crucial for the growing field of antibody-based therapies.\n*   **Protein Engineering:** AI can assist in engineering proteins for therapeutic purposes, optimizing their stability, activity, and delivery.\n\n**Examples of Companies and Platforms Leading the Way:**\n\n*   **Exscientia:** Known for using AI to discover novel drug candidates that have entered clinical trials.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Leverages AI and automation to map cellular biology and discover new drug targets and therapies.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery, predicting how small molecules will bind to target proteins.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** A prominent player in generative AI for drug discovery, aiming to accelerate the entire drug development pipeline.\n*   **Schrödinger:** While not solely an AI company, they integrate AI and machine learning into their physics-based computational platform for drug discovery.\n\n**Key Trends and Innovations:**\n\n*   **\"AI First\" Drug Discovery Companies:** A new wave of biotech startups is being founded with AI at their core, rather than as an add-on.\n*   **Data Integration is Key:** The ability to integrate and analyze massive, diverse datasets (chemical, biological, clinical) is critical for AI's success in drug discovery.\n*   **Human-AI Collaboration:** The most effective approach often involves AI augmenting the work of human scientists, rather than replacing them entirely. AI can explore possibilities, and humans provide critical oversight, intuition, and experimental validation.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges persist, including:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Availability:** High-quality, standardized biological and chemical data is essential for training robust AI models.\n*   **\"Black Box\" Problem:** Ensuring that AI-generated insights are interpretable and trustworthy is crucial for regulatory approval and clinical adoption.\n*   **Translational Challenges:** Bridging the gap between in silico predictions and real-world biological efficacy and safety remains a significant hurdle.\n*   **Cost and Scalability:** While AI aims to reduce costs, developing and deploying these sophisticated platforms still requires significant investment.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just a tool in drug discovery anymore; it's becoming an integral part of the entire process, fundamentally changing how we identify, design, and test new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're interested in the second development I mentioned: **Advanced Target Identification and Validation using AI.** This is a really exciting area because finding the *right* target is often the first and most critical step in developing a successful drug.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what this development entails:\n\n**The Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\nFor decades, drug discovery has relied on a mix of biological intuition, hypothesis-driven research, and serendipity to identify potential targets (usually proteins or genes involved in a disease). This process can be:\n\n*   **Slow and Laborious:** It often involves years of painstaking lab work and research.\n*   **Limited by Human Capacity:** It's difficult for any single scientist or team to sift through the sheer volume of biological data being generated.\n*   **Prone to Bias:** Researchers might unintentionally focus on well-studied targets or pathways, potentially overlooking novel ones.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns and connections in massive, complex datasets. Here's how it's being applied to target identification:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Multi-omics Data:** This is the cornerstone. AI can integrate and analyze data from various biological \"layers\":\n    *   **Genomics:** DNA sequences, mutations, genetic variations.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** Gene expression levels (which genes are turned on or off).\n    *   **Proteomics:** Protein abundance, modifications, and interactions.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** Levels of small molecules involved in cellular processes.\n    *   **Epigenomics:** Modifications to DNA that affect gene activity.\n    *   **Clinical Data:** Patient health records, symptoms, treatment responses.\n\n    By analyzing these together, AI can identify genes, proteins, or pathways that are consistently dysregulated in a disease state, even if the connection isn't immediately obvious.\n\n2.  **Uncovering Novel Disease Mechanisms:** AI can go beyond simply identifying a \"bad actor.\" It can:\n    *   **Map complex biological networks:** Understanding how different molecules interact within a cell or organism.\n    *   **Identify causal relationships:** Differentiating between factors that *cause* a disease versus those that are merely *associated* with it.\n    *   **Discover disease subtypes:** Recognizing that a disease might manifest differently in different patient populations, each requiring a specific target.\n\n3.  **Predicting Target Druggability:** Once a potential target is identified, the next question is: \"Can we actually make a drug that hits it effectively and safely?\" AI is being used to predict:\n    *   **Binding potential:** How likely is it that a drug molecule can bind to the target protein?\n    *   **\"Druggable pocket\" prediction:** Does the protein have a suitable site for a drug to bind?\n    *   **Off-target effects:** Could a drug targeting this protein also interact with other proteins, leading to side effects?\n\n4.  **Leveraging Real-World Evidence (RWE):** AI can analyze vast amounts of anonymized RWE from electronic health records, insurance claims, and wearable devices. This allows researchers to:\n    *   **Observe disease progression in real-world settings.**\n    *   **Identify patterns in patient responses to existing treatments (or lack thereof).**\n    *   **Discover new indications for existing drugs or identify novel targets based on observed patient outcomes.**\n\n5.  **Integrating Scientific Literature:** AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) can \"read\" and understand millions of scientific papers, extracting key information about genes, proteins, diseases, and experimental results. This helps researchers stay on top of the latest findings and identify potential links they might have missed.\n\n**Examples in Action:**\n\n*   **Oncology:** AI is being used to identify novel cancer-driving mutations or resistance mechanisms, leading to the development of targeted therapies. For example, identifying a specific protein overexpressed in a subset of tumors that can be targeted with an antibody.\n*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** AI is helping researchers understand the complex genetic and molecular underpinnings of diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, pointing to new protein targets for intervention.\n*   **Rare Diseases:** For diseases with limited human data, AI can analyze animal models, cell lines, and pathway databases to infer potential targets.\n\n**The \"Validation\" Aspect:**\n\nCrucially, AI doesn't just *identify* a target; it also aids in its *validation*. By predicting druggability and potential outcomes, AI helps researchers prioritize which targets are most promising for further experimental investigation, saving time and resources by focusing on the most likely candidates.\n\nIn essence, AI is transforming target identification from a somewhat artisanal process into a data-driven, high-throughput endeavor, significantly increasing the chances of discovering truly novel and effective treatments.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Several types of companies are actively involved in leveraging AI for **Advanced Target Identification and Validation**, ranging from established pharmaceutical giants to specialized AI-driven biotech startups.

Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
